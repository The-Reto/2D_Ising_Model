# Ising Model (2 dimensional)
An implementation of the two dimensional Ising model. The temperature can be set relative to the coupling strenght ( J ) when executing the program. The code also allows for outputting animations (using the gnu-plot script provided). See the "Examples" folder for example outputs.
